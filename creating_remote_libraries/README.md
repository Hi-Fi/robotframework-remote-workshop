# Developing of remote usable libraries

Development of the remote usable libraries is easy as longs as there're no files involved (either from or to file system).
It just requires selection of suitable remote server, write the implementation according instructions from server, 
and testing.

This directory container steps to practice creation of the remote library, and tries to highlight some caveats
encountered by remote libraries.
